About
---------------
This tool was developed for the upgrade of the moodle installation of the [Rovira i Virgili University](http://moodle.urv.cat).

Tips
---------------
- Before making the "real" upgrade run periodical upgrades on a test machine. This will help catch upgrade bugs before the production upgrade day.
- Run all your commands from a terminal multiplexer like **screen** or **tmux** to avoid the shell becoming unresponsive or having to leave your terminal logged on for the whole process.
- If your installation has **huge** tables of historical logs, these can be upgraded before the rest of the site, during the upgrade tests and later on can be added to the production website. This can short drastically the upgrade time.
